## When is learning most memorable, meaningful, and transformative?

We learn a lot everyday. And some of the learning we do is particularly special. Maybe it is special because we remember it for a long time, or because it has personal meaning and significance for us. Or maybe it was special because it fundamentally changed how we think, act, and create in the world.

    <h3 class="card-title">Reflections on memorable, meaningful, and transformative learning</h3>
    <p class="card-text">Think of a time you learned something that was <em>memorable</em>, <em>meaningful</em>, and perhaps even <em>transformative</em>. This experience might have been in an academic environment, but it could also have happened outside of a "formal" learning context.</p>

        <li>What did you learn?</li>
        <li><em>How</em> did it happen?</li>
        <li>Who was involved?</li>
        <li>What was the environment like?</li>
        <li>What other impressions or memories do you have of your learning experience?</li>
    </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Think about the many contexts in which you learn. For example, you might write about learning to do something creative, or a time you were travelling and learned something about different cultures. Any story or memory you have of an impactful learning experience will work for this exploration!</li>
