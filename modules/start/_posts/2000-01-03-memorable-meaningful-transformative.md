## When is learning most memorable, meaningful, and transformative?

We learn a lot everyday. But some of the learning we do is particularly special. Maybe it is special because we remember it for a long time, or because it has personal meaning and significance for us. Or maybe it was special because it fundamentally changed how we think, act, and create in the world.

Think of a time you learned something that was *memorable*, *meaningful*, and perhaps even *transformative*. This experience might be academic - but it could also have happened outside of a "formal" learning context.

* What did you learn?
* *How* did it happen?
* Who was involved?
* What was the environment like?
* What other impressions or memories do you have of your learning experience?

Write a quick 3-5 minute reflection in your notebook. Then, read through what you have written and underline the key points you would like to share with your team.

## Tips:

* You can think of this as a free-write where your focus is on freely and fearlessly sharing your ideas. Don't worry about grammar or writing style or anything else!
* If it helps to draw pictures and doodles, or to map out the experience visually, go for it!

## Share your story
When you finish, share your experiences with a member of your team. As you share, look for similarities and differences based on your experiences. Be sure to listen first, and then comment, question, and engage with the ideas shared by your team.
