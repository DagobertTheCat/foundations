## What makes memorable, meaningful, and transformative learning happen?

In this part of the activity, you'll turn your experiences into a list of characteristics of memorable, meaningful, and transformative learning.

To get started, think about the stories shared by your team in the previous activity. Talk with your team about characteristics of learning you noticed in these stories. It might help to think about how you might complete the following sentences:

>
Learning is most (memorable / meaningful / transformative) when: ______________.
>

>
(Memorable / meaningful / transformative) learning often involves: ______________.
>

Next, take a few minutes to jot down a list of your own ideas in your notebook.

Once you have a good list of at least 6-10 characteristics, take a look at the list of ideas compiled by previous groups, below.

{% include placeholder.html %}

## Talk with your team:

* Are you noticing any groupings or categories in these lists?
* Are there any ideas that potentially contradict each other? For example, do some suggest learning should be "challenging" and others "comfortable"? If so, what do we do with these potentially contradictory ideas? What other examples like this can you find?
* What are the most important ideas for you as a learner? For the learners you work with?

## Personalize it

Based in your discussions, create a revised "Top-5" list of the characteristics of memorable, meaningful, and transformative learning *specifically for you*. Write this list down in your notebook. We will come back to this list later!
