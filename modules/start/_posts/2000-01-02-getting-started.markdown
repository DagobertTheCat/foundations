## What do we need to get started?

You're ready!

This mini-course is designed around the idea that sharing our personal experiences with learning is the best possible starting point for learner-centered design. So, that means you have all the background knowledge you need to get started!

<!--In this mini-course you will complete a series of practical, creative, and hands-on activities. Along the way, you will write about and discuss your experiences, reflect on key ideas, and roll your sleeves up to start creating storyboards and prototypes.-->

>
All you really need is a team and a notebook.

While this mini-course can be taken individually, it works best when you can work with at least one other person to share experiences and gather feedback on your work.

<h3>{% include icon-notebook.html %}And why a notebook?</h3>

Throughout the course you will be jotting down notes and reflections, asking questions, and getting started with prototyping and storyboarding. You will want to keep all of this great work organized into some sort of notebook. It could digital, e.g., a google doc, or on paper. The most important thing is that you dedicate time and energy to exploring and capturing your thoughts and ideas as you learn!

## Ready?

To get started, write your first entry in your notebook:

* What do you hope to learn in this mini-course?
* What are you most curious about and what questions do you have at this point?
