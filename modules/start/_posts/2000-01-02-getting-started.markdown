## What do we need to get started?

>
All you really need is a team and a notebook.
>

You're ready! This mini-course is designed around the idea that sharing our personal learning experiences is the best possible starting point for learner-centered design. So, that means you have all the background knowledge you need to get started!

<!--In this mini-course you will complete a series of practical, creative, and hands-on activities. Along the way, you will write about and discuss your experiences, reflect on key ideas, and roll your sleeves up to start creating storyboards and prototypes.-->

<!-- todo: team and notebook visuals -->
<!-- consider developing css for team activity and notebook activity and introducing them here -->

While this mini-course can be taken individually, it works best when you can work with at least one other person to share experiences and gather feedback on your work.

<h3>{% include icon-notebook.html %}And why a notebook?</h3>

Throughout the course you will jot down notes and reflections, ask questions, and create prototypes and storyboards. You will want to keep all of this great work organized into some sort of notebook. It could be digital, e.g., in a google doc, or on paper. The most important thing is that you dedicate time and energy to exploring and capturing your thoughts and ideas as you learn!
