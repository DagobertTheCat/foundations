         <p class="card-text">Think about the stories shared in the previous activity. Work with your team to brainstorm a list of the characteristics of learning you noticed in these stories. It might help you to think about how you would complete the following sentences:</p>
         <blockquote>Learning is most memorable when: ______________.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Learning is most meaningful when: ______________.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Learning is most transformative when: ______________.</blockquote>

        <p class="card-text">Talk together with your team about the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What themes or categories are you noticing?</li>
            <li>How can we balance seemingly contradictory ideas? For example, how do we make learning environments both "challenging" and "comfortable"?</li>
            <li>What are the most important ideas for you as a learner? For the learners you work with?</li>
        </ul>
