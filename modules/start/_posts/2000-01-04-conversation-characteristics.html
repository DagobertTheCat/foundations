        <ul>
            <li>What themes or categories are you noticing?</li>
            <li>Are there any ideas that potentially contradict each other? For example, do some suggest learning should be "challenging" and others "comfortable"? If so, what do we do with these potentially contradictory ideas? What other examples like this can you find?</li>
            <li>What are the most important ideas for you as a learner? For the learners you work with?</li>
