        <p class="card-text">Talk together with your team about the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What themes or categories are you noticing?</li>
            <li>How can we balance seemingly contradictory ideas? For example, how do we make learning environments both "challenging" and "comfortable"?</li>
            <li>What are the most important ideas for you as a learner? For the learners you work with?</li>
