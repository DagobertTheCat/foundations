## Welcome!

In this mini-course you will explore learner-centerd design by completing a series of practical, creative, and hands-on activities. Along the way, you will write about and discuss your learning experiences, reflect on key ideas in teaching and learning, and roll your sleeves up to start creating storyboards and prototypes.

## What will we learn?

As you actively engage with the activities in this mini-course, you will strengthen your ability to:

* Relate key ideas in learning and teaching to your own personal experiences
* Map out the challenges, breakthroughs, and outcomes in a learning process
* Center your designs around learners and the learning process

As you learn, you and your team will also create a <strong>manifesto for learning and teaching</strong> and make <strong>storyboards and prototypes</strong> of learning materials.

## How long will it take?

Each module of the mini-course should take about 90 minutes, but could take longer, depending on how deep you dive into the discussion, and how involved you get in the creative process.

## Who created this mini-course?

This mini-course is based on the foundational training for <a href="https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/about/" target="_blank">WI+RE</a>, a learner-led design team at UCLA. The initial version of the training was created by Doug Worsham and Shannon Roux. Each cohort of learners that have taken the training have further developed and improved it as well.
