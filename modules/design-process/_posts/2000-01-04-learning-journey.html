<h2>Learning Journey Mapping</h2>

<p>Thinking about learning as a journey can help you and your team:</p>

<ul>
    <li>break down complex outcomes into smaller tasks,</li>
    <li>situate your learning outcomes within the learner's process,</li>
    <li>identify learning outcomes you may want to explore in your design.</li>
</ul>

    <p class="card-text">This learning journey map explores the challenge of working in groups on an experimental research project. The designer has identified a possible learning outcome, and then brainstormed how to set learners up for success (in the left box) and what learners will do next (in the right box).</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Download the <a href="https://ucla.app.box.com/v/build-something-toolkit" target="_blank">Build Something Toolkit</a> and print a blank learning journey map template for each member of your design team.</li>
        <li>Quickly review the learning challenge that you are working on with your team.</li>
        <li>Ask each member of your design team to work individually to create a learning journey map for this challenge. Work rapidly, generating ideas individually for no more than 3-4 minutes, or about about 1 minute for each of the questions on the learning journey map.</li>
        <li>Come back together as a team to share and compile your ideas. Work together to identify the actions and learning outcomes that will be most helpful for learners. Use this process to narrow down the scope of your project to focus on a small number of manageable learning outcomes.</li>
    </ol>

        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <ul>
             <li>Revisit your empathy map. What are some of the hidden or invisible challenges learners might face? What can learners do to overcome these challenges?</li>
            <li>Identify the steps that experts sometimes forget they do, or do automatically and/or unconsciously. Think about how to make these steps easily understandable for learners.</li>
