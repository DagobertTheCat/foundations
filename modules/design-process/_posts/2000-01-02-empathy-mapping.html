<h2>Empathy Mapping</h2>

<p>Empathy mapping is a design technique that you and your team can use to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>center your design around learners and their goals,</li>
    <li>situate your design ideas in real-world learning contexts,</li>
    <li>and develop insight into key breakthroughs in the learning process.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to make an empathy map</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Download the <a href="https://ucla.app.box.com/v/build-something-toolkit" target="_blank">Build Something Toolkit</a> and print out a blank empathy map for each member of your design team.</li>
    <li>Identify the challenge you would like to explore and write this on the top of the empathy map.</li>
    <li>Reflect on the learners and their goals: Who are the learners? What background knowledge do they have? What are their goals? Areas of expertise? How do learners currently approach this challenge?</li>
    <li>Explore the contexts in which learning will happen & identify requirements and expectations: Is this a required course? Do learners have equal access to information and materials? How does grading/evaluation work? Are grading expectations clear for all learners? What other contextual factors might impact learning?</li>
    <li>Identify breakthroughs and aha moments in the learning process that will help learners achieve their goals and meet the requirements and expectations.</li>
</ol>

<p>First, download the <a href="https://ucla.app.box.com/v/build-something-toolkit" target="_blank">Build Something Toolkit</a> and print a blank empathy map template for each member of your design team.</p>

<p>Next, identify a major challenge you would like to explore with your team (e.g., “writing an effective literature review”).</p>

<p>Then, ask each member of your design team to work individually to create an empathy map for this challenge. Work rapidly, brainstorming for no more than 5 minutes. This means your team will work for about 1 minute brainstorming ideas for each of the following questions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Reflect on the learners and their goals: Who are the learners? What background knowledge do they have?</li>
    <li>What are their goals? Areas of expertise? How do learners currently approach this challenge?</li>
    <li>Explore the contexts in which learning will happen & identify requirements and expectations. Is this a required course? Do learners have equal access to information and materials? How does grading/evaluation work? Are grading expectations clear for all learners? What other contextual factors might impact learning?</li>
    <li>Identify breakthroughs and aha moments in the learning process that will help learners achieve their goals and meet the requirements and expectations.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a team, share and compile your ideas. Map out different perspectives on the learners, their goals, and the learning contexts. Most importantly, begin to inventory the most important breakthroughs that will help learners achieve their goals.</p>

<h4>Tips</h4>
<ul>
    <li>In addition to working with your design team, consider working directly with your stakeholder groups on empathy mapping activities.</li>
    <li>Explore the diversity of learners and learning contexts, as well as the commonalities.</li>
    <li>Question your assumptions and actively identify unknowns. Write your questions and unknowns directly on the empathy map.</li>
</ul>
