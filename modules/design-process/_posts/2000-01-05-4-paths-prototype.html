<h2>Four Paths Prototyping</h2>

<p>Four paths prototyping helps you quickly develop a variety of ways to address a challenge. You can use four paths with your team to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>leverage divergent thinking to explore multiple pathways,</li>
    <li>explore your learning outcomes across different forms of media,</li>
    <li>select an initial approach for further prototyping.</li>
</ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">How to explore 4 paths</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Download the <a href="https://ucla.app.box.com/v/build-something-toolkit" target="_blank">Build Something Toolkit</a> and print a blank 4 paths prototype template for each member of your design team.</li>
        <li>Quickly articulate the learning outcome(s) you would like to focus on in this activity. You may want every member of your team focused on the same learning outcome, or you may choose to have different team members focus on different learning outcomes.</li>
        <li>Ask each member of your design team to work individually to create 4 prototypes for each learning outcome. Sketch and generate ideas for 1-2 minutes per prototype, for a total of no more than 4-6 minutes for the entire activity.</li>
        <li>Come back together as a team to share and compile your ideas. Work together to label pathways based on criteria you generate as a team (e.g., most feasible, biggest impact, most fun to make, etc.).</li>

        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <ul>
             <li>Explore all options freely and without worry.</li>
            <li>Let yourself consider print, digital, video, audio, interactive exhibit, performance art, animation, in-person activities, anything!</li>
