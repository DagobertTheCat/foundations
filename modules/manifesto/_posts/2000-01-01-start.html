<h2>Making your learning manifesto.</h2>

<p>What values will drive your work? When faced with too many options, or too few paths forward, what will you do?</p>

<p>Values-driven design can help you and your team overcome the most difficult challenges. And co-articulating shared values with your team is an inspiring way to launch a design process.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Jot down a prelinary list of ideas for your own personal design manifesto.</li>
        <li>Try to list at least 5 or more items that you are passionate about and that can help you with your design process.</li>
        <li>to work on.</li>

        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Review the work you have done in your notebook and with your team so far. What values will guide your work? What challenges do you anticipate and how will you overcome them?</li>
            <li>Notice how each manifesto item can help address common challenges with the creative process. For example, declaring that you want to "build imperfect solutions quickly and on purpose" can help you address the common challenge of perfectionism. Declaring that you want to "work with what you have" can help you encourage a DIY approach.</li>
            <li>If you need ideas, check out other manifestos for inspiration (e.g., <a href="https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/wire-way/">the WI+RE way</a>.</li>
