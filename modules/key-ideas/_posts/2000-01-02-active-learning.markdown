## What is active learning?

In active learning approaches, both teachers and learners are actively engaged in the learning process. But what does that really mean? Despite being a rather simple idea, "active learning" can be notoriously difficult to define. That's why in this and future sections, we will be focused on helping you figure out what these key ideas mean to you!

<!-- todo: develop an interactive reader approach for sections like this - something like a slideshow with large quotes and compelling illustrations -->
<!-- interactive reader could be made in h5p -->

To get the conversation started, read the following quick definitions and descriptions of active learning from the Cornell University Center for Teaching Excellence <!-- todo: citation and link needed -->:

* Active learning is "anything that involves students in doing things and thinking about the things they are doing" (Bonwell & Eison, 1991, p. 2).
* Felder & Brent (2009) define active learning as anything "other than simply watching, listening and taking notes" (p. 2).
* Active learning strategies can be as short as a few minutes long.
* Active learning techniques can be integrated into a lecture or any other classroom setting relatively easily. Even large classrooms can involve learning activities beyond the traditional lecture format.

<!-- todo: consider - experiential learning, pair and group work, problem-based learning, desirable difficulty, flow -->

## What are your experiences?

What are your experiences with "active learning"? What do you think about it?

Think of a learning experience you have had that seemed particularly *active* to you.

Jot down a quick (1-2 minute) reflection in your notebook on the experience. You might consider one or more of the following questions:

* What was the setting and what were you learning?
* What made the learning "active"? Was it experiential in some way? Collaborative? Challenging? ...?
* Was this learning experience memorable? Meaninful? Transformative? Why or why not?
