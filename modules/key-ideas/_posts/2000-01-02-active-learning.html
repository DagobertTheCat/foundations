<h2>What is active learning?</h2>

<p>In active learning approaches, both teachers and learners are actively engaged in the learning process. But what does that really mean?</p>
<!--Even though it might seem like a rather simple idea, "active learning" can be notoriously difficult to define. That's why in this and future sections, we will be focused on helping you figure out what these key ideas mean to you!-->

<p>To get the conversation started, work with your team (or individually) on the following <em>interactive reader</em> on active learning.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Think of a learning experience you have had that seemed particularly <em>active</em> to you. Jot down a quick (2-3 minute) reflection in your notebook on the experience. You might consider one or more of the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What was the setting and what were you learning?</li>
        <li>What made the learning "active"? Was it experiential in some way? Collaborative? Challenging? ...?</li>
        <li>Was this learning experience memorable? Meaninful? Transformative? Why or why not?</li>
