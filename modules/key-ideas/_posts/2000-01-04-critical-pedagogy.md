## What is critical pedagogy?

Critical pedagogy involves critical questioning of the status quo, and often is focused on both transformation and promoting social change and social justice. It involves:

"Habits of thought, reading, writing, and speaking which go beneath surface meaning, first impressions, dominant myths, official pronouncements, traditional clichÃ©s, received wisdom, and mere opinions, to understand deep meanings, root causes, social contexts, ideologies, and personal consequences of any action, event, object, process, organization, experience, text, subject matter, policy, mass media, or discourse."
Adapted from Ira Shor, Empowering Education, 129

Proponents of critical pedagogy have argued that "teachers and students should be co-creators of knowledge within the classroom, and dominant ideologies should be exposed for critique and discussion."

Building on this idea, bell hooks writes,

"When everyone in the classroom, teaching and students, recognizes that they are responsible for crating a learning community together, learning is at its most meaningful and useful."

These ideas challenge traditional conceptions of power and authority within the classroom itself and suggest new possibilities for learning and teaching.

## What are your experiences?

In your notebook, write a quick (1-2 minute) reflection on the following questions, and then select a few ideas to share with your team:

* Have you been involved in a learning experience related to critical pedagogy?
* Have you ever had a learning experience that involved questioning your own assumptions or beliefs? Looking deeply and critically at common societal conventions or beliefs? If so, what was this experience like for you and other learners?
* Have you ever had a learning experience that challenged the traditional dynamics between teachers and learners?
* Was the experience transformative? Why or why not?
* In what ways is the video we watched previously an example or not an example of critical pedagogy in practice?
