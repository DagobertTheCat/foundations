## Sharing one of your learning stories

Next, let's bring together what you have learned so far in this mini-course by writing a short (200-250 word) learning narrative in your notebook.

Here are a few questions to get you choose a learning experience to write about:

* What was the most compelling learning experience you have experienced?
* Which of your learning experiences would make the most interesting story?
<!--* In discussing your learning with your team, which of your stories did they find most surprising or interesting?-->

Once you have a few ideas for learning experiences that you might want to write about, watch the following playlist of learning narratives created by previous participants in this mini-course.

## Team sharing (and celebration)
<!-- todo: more constructive name for this? -->

Share your learning narrative with a member of your team. Ask for their thoughts on the following questions:

* What did you like best about the story and why?
* What was the most pivotal or interesting moment in the story for you? Why?
* Which ideas about learning and teaching come through in the story for you?
