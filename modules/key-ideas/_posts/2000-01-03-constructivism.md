## What is constructivism?

The basic idea of constructivism is that

1. we learn when we actively *construct* or *build* knowledge
2. and, in order to build knowledge, we make connections between our previous experiences, current ideas, and the new concepts we are learning.

In this way our previous experiences are like a foundation or scaffolding which helps us understand new ideas and concepts.

Choose one or more of the links below to do a deeper exploration of constructivism. As you read and explore, take notes in your notebook. Be sure to jot down the quotes and ideas that help you develop your understanding. Also jot down any connections you make between your own experiences and your reading.

When you are ready, jot down a 1-2 minute reflection in your notebook on one or more of the following questions:

* What did you read?
* What were your favorite quotes/ideas from your reading?
* Can you think of an example in which a teacher has helped you learn a new concept by explaining how it is related to something you already know? If so, what happened? How did this approach impact your learning?


Readings (choose one of the following to explore):

* Quick overview of Constructivism: https://ucla.box.com/s/klsdqncbb6564x94dt14st468qy5bzix 
* Entry on Constructivism from "Concept to Classroom" - http://www.thirteen.org/edonline/concept2class/constructivism/index.html
* Entry on "Learning Theory" in the Gale Virtual Reference Library - find the section called "CONSTRUCTIVIST APPROACH"  http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GVRL&sw=w&u=uclosangeles&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CCX3403200370&asid=b1acc965238d14bd60cfc5ab6a1717af
<!-- todo: explore a visual reader approach. how might we turn these readings into a slideshow and/or visual/compelling overview? -->
    
## What is social-constructivism?

Social-Constructivism adds a *social* layer to constructivist approaches to learning.

From a social constructivist perspective, we learn when we interact with each other to build knowledge.

These interactions - sharing our previous experiences, exploring ideas together, and collaboratively engaging with new concepts - are the key components of social knowledge building. One interesting possibility is that through sharing our knowledge, we can both:

1. build a broader and more diverse foudnation for new learning (i.e., a "shared scaffolding")
2. and, co-create new knowledge together that benefits from our diverse backgrounds and experiences

For a closer look at these ideas, read the following overview of Social Constructivism from the Berkeley Graduate Division's Graduate Student Instructor Teaching & Research Center.

## What are your experiences?

In your notebook, write a quick, 3 minute reflection on the following question:

* Have you ever experienced social-constructivist learning (or something similar)? Or - asked another way - Have you ever felt that you were a part of a learning community?
* If so, what was the experience like? What were you learning? What kinds of knowledge did you build together? How did the social aspects impact learning?
* Meta-moment: What are some examples of social-constructivist learning you have noticed in this mini-course?

## Talk about it with your team

* What are your experiences with social-constructivist learning?
* Thinking back to the video we watched previously, in what ways is this instructor demonstrating (and/or not demonstrating) social-constructivist teaching?
* How does your team encourage knowledge and community building? What other practices might you explore?
