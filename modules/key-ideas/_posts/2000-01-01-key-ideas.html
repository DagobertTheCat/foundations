<h2>Key Ideas in Learning and Teaching</h2>

<p>In this mini-course, we take a practical approach to learning theory by connecting theories, which we call "key ideas," with your real life experiences.</p>

<p>In this section, we will start by looking closely at an example of classroom learning in a university lecture hall. We will use this example to explore several key ideas about learning and teaching.</p>

<p>Then, you'll connect those key ideas with your own experiences as a learner, and share your experiences with your team.</p>

<p>By the end of this section, you'll have started drafting a short narrative about a memorable, meaningful, or transformative learning experience in your life.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Let's start by watching a quick video of some classroom learning and teaching that illustrates several of the key ideas we will be talking about in this section.</p>
    <p class="card-text">As you watch the video, take notes and look for examples and evidence of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>active engagement by both learners and teachers</li>
        <li>learners interacting with each other to learn and experience new things</li>
        <li>learners exploring and questioning the status quo or other personal or social norms</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-3">Talk with your team:</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>What evidence did you see of active engagement by learners? by teachers?</li>
          <li>What kinds of interactions did you see? How did these compare to the usual approaches to lecture hall instruction?</li>
          <li>Think about your <a href="{{ 'modules/start/conversation-characteristics/' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">"Top 5" list</a> of the characteristics of memorable, meaningful, and transformative learning. Which of your characteristics were present in this teaching example? Which were not?</li>
