<h2>What is universal design?</h2>

<p>Universal design calls for:</p>
    
<blockquote>The design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080509071827/http://www.design.ncsu.edu/cud/about_ud/udprinciplestext.htm" target="_blank">The Center for Universal Design - NC State University, 1997</a>).</blockquote>

<p>When designing for learners, this means that learning experiences and materials benefit ALL students when learning materials are accessible, diverse and inclusive.</p>

    <h3 class="card-title">Exploring Universal Design for Learning</h3>
    <p class="card-text">Have you ever had a learning experience that you felt just wasn't designed for you? With your team, explore the diversity of learners, their experiences, and their different approaches to learning. How will this impact your team's design approach?</p>
      <p>Next, choose a website that your team frequently uses, and explore it using WAVE - the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool: <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">http://wave.webaim.org/</a></p>
      <p>This tool gives you a chance to take a behind the scenes look at the accessibility of a website and identify both best practices and areas of improvement.</p>
      <p>What did you notice about the website you visted? In what ways is it accessible? How could it be improved?</p>
